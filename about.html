    <h2>PARKCHESTER HISTORY</h2>
    <p>
    Parkchester is a planned neighborhood that was built by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company located in the Bronx, New York. It was built for middle-class families, and only permitted White people to live in the community. Parkchester was designed with a utopian, garden-city vision in mind, the perfect blend of the urban and suburban.
    <br><br>
    Instead of the tenement style-housing that plagued Lower Manhattan, the
    thinkers behind Parkchester envisioned a community that had everything it needed at its fingertips. The architects on the project used only one-quarter of the 129 acres for buildings, and left the rest for open space.  Amenities they chose include a baseball field, basketball courts, tetherball courts, and 20+ playgrounds. MetLife prized the idea of a lush, green space, and planted more than 4,000 oak, sycamore and maple trees, spending $300,000 of their overall budget on landscaping.
    <br><br>
    Parkchester consists of 171 four-sided brick buildings, of varying heights for
    architectural interest. The buildings are 8-13 stories high and numbered M through 7 and M through 12.  As of 1941, Parkchester was the largest housing
    development ever built in the US. As of 2020, 300,602 people currently reside
    in Parkchester.
    <br><br>
    Parkchester is best known for its terracotta sculptures that dot the buildings throughout the neighborhood. Many of these works are credited to sculptor
    Joseph Kiselewski.</p>

    <h2>STUYVESANT TOWN-PETER COOPER VILLAGE HISTORY</h2>
    <p>
    Stuyvesant Town is a large post World War 2 neighborhood on the east side of Midtown Manhattan. Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village contain 11,250 apartments. This complex was funded by the Metropolitan Life Insurance
    Company. Stuytown-Peter Cooper replaced a derelict neighborhood called
    the Gas House District (notorious for gang activity and endemic pollution as
    a result of gas storage units in the neighborhood).
    <br><br>
    MET Life, armed with experience from the successes of its Parkchester
    development, spearheaded the funding and execution of the complex. At
    this point, the domineering Parks Commissioner Robert Moses was tapped
    to promote the project. Stuytown-Peter Cooper Village was also a Whites
    only community.</p>
    
    <h2>OVERLAP AND DIFFERENCES</h2>
    <p>
    Both complexes were funded by Metropolitan Life and promoted under the guise of developing mass affordable housing in a city that was in desperate need of it. They both were founded with the ideals of renting to a predominantly middle class and White resident pool. We can draw, however, many distinctions.
