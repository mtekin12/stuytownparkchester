            <h2>PARKCHESTER</h2>

<p>
    “John Dearie was known within the four quardrants as a “real Parkchester boy” who had made good. A second-generation resident whose family had moved into a two-bedroom apartment at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/1735+Purdy+St,+The+Bronx,+NY+10462/@40.8414507,-73.8547485,3a,75y,313.22h,88.81t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sApBQse54sxwlufg0qiF9Aw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c2f4ba15eef9c1:0x5d3b610cf5b3d8b0!8m2!3d40.8414635!4d-73.8550925!16s%2Fg%2F11fm_llpg7">1735 Purdy Street</a> in 1941, Dearie first gained local attention as an outstanding athlete on the concrete courts of the North Quadrant.” (Gurock, 171)

    “Another Parkchester child of the 1950s, Peter Carolyn, noted another significant neighborhood venue where blacks were never around. After spirited games of basketball with and against Jewish players in the <a href=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Noble+Playground/@40.8366921,-73.8722886,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipNoXSTmBkWMuuskQi25cGBhVv3rIf23Lwc-degf!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipNoXSTmBkWMuuskQi25cGBhVv3rIf23Lwc-degf%3Dw114-h86-k-no!7i4032!8i3024!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c2f4ecba708695:0xc1c64044a1083b41!8m2!3d40.8372519!4d-73.8722287!16s%2Fg%2F11h0swryk> West Quadrant playground</a>, Carolan would go off to the local candy store on White Plains Road, a block west of Parkchester. There he would see black youngsters of his age, but he never played with them in the development’s designated recreational areas in daylight hours.” (Gurock, 127)

    “Occupationally, many of the families, no matter their age cohort, fit the pattern of workers, civil servants, and lower-middle-class clerks and salesmen that Parkchester was keen to welcome. As a sign of those times, none of the women raising children worked outside the home. Julius Horowitz passed away in 1972,  but Irene was destined to live in her <a href=https://www.google.com/maps/place/McGraw+Ave,+The+Bronx,+NY/@40.834997,-73.861176,3a,75y,127.59h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sGOHW244ZD_lRpX9zFiAIpQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DGOHW244ZD_lRpX9zFiAIpQ%26cb_client%3Dsearch.gws-prod.gps%26w%3D86%26h%3D86%26yaw%3D127.59219%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c2f4c0ea40ad7d:0xdbd38e8158afa04e!8m2!3d40.8347008!4d-73.860047!16s%2Fg%2F1td9fpmx> McGraw Avenue </a> apartment until her passing age at one hundred.” (Gurock, 33)

    “Profiles in a Bronx weekly as 'immigrants living [the] American dream, Bangledeshis Saleh (Sal) Uddin and Shariful (Sharif) Islam entered the Parkchester real estate business in 2002, almost a generation after…other South Asians started buying and renting. It was a propitious time, with the rehabilitation of the neighborhood well underway. Uddin had come to the United States in 1991 with a degree in public administration and settled originally in Woodside, Queens. During his first decade in America, he worked as a salesman-consultant and eventually as a district manager for Vitamin Shoppe, a pharmaceutical chain. Though advancing in the company and saving his money, he chafed at his inability to make a really substantial living as an employee. He was meanwhile aware of the possibilities in local real estate and the recent history of Parkchester, having rented an upstairs apartment from a fellow Bangladeshi on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Virginia+Ave,+The+Bronx,+NY/@40.8306483,-73.8627604,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c2f4c3e4c6c741:0xa2a3d7482462c885!8m2!3d40.8306483!4d-73.8605717!16s%2Fg%2F1tgz6dp7">Virginia Avenue</a>  not far from the complex. He joined Shariful Islam in a start-up firm and began buying and renting to fellow Bangladeshis and members of other nationalities who were seeking residency in the affordable neighborhood. Islam had come to the U.S. in 1990 and earned a business degree from Baruch College. While he pursued higher education, Island worked as a waiter in Manhattan restaurants. Together, Uddin and Island demonstrated their commitment to the ethnically diversified neighborhood when they bought condominiums in Parkchester- Islam in 2004, Uddin a year later. In 2012, Islam purchased a home on Gleason Avenue; as of 2017, Uddin and his family still resided in Parkchester and their operation, Parkchester Bronx Reality, Inc., was flourishing.” (Gurock, 222-223)

    “Moving beyond words of protest, in the spring of 1950 the Parkchester Committee to End Housing Discrimination was formed. Its first effort was a petition drive to demonstrate that residents of the community were in favor of blacks living among them. The findings gave the integrationists some hope that rank-and-file Parkchesterites were willing to ‘welcome’ blacks. Polling conducted in the West Quadrant revealed 58 percent ‘favored the admission of Negroes to the project on a full equality basis.’ The committee was quick to note that these affirmative respondents included both those who were willing to sign a petition in support of open housing and those who were unwilling to lend their names publicly ‘because of fear of repercussions.’ However, the latter cohort surely could not be counted upon to take action against the MLIC [Metropolitan Life Insurance Corporation.] Meanwhile, 30 percent ‘issues a flat ‘no’ when queried, while 12 percent had not made up their minds.” (Gurock, 111-112)

“<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Stuyvesant+Town-Peter+Cooper+Village,+New+York,+NY/@40.731712,-73.9823802,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c259737e225aa1:0x652ff78189c0e104!8m2!3d40.7316903!4d-73.9778494!16zL20vMDN0eXg3">Stuyvesant Town.</a> If this were a novel you would think I made it up.Imagine some giant hand leveling eighteen square blocks of Manhattan tenements, and in their place constructing a utopia of brick apartments laid out around a large central green called the Oval. The only streets, four semicircular drives, one on each side of the perimeter…[with] twelve fenced playgrounds, some with swings and slides, some with basketball hoops, some simply square open spaces. On hot afternoons, in some of the playgrounds, huge showers were turned on…and we children ran, screaming, through the icy water.” (Demas, 2, 2000)

    “Unlike the vast city public housing projects in ghetto neighborhoods, meccas of despair, Stuyvesant Town was a middle-class community where little girls took piano lessons and were expected to go to college. If our fathers weren’t doctors or dentists, lawyers or school principals, they worked in offices and on hot days still wore their jackets home from work, with their ties just loosened. If our mothers worked at all, they were teachers. When families got wealthier they bought homes in Scarsdale or Darien or moved up to apartments in Peter Cooper. Some just stayed and kept their money in any one of the banks nearby on <a href=https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7629264,-73.959566,3a,75y,66.23h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sgOwuWmKrnqbO8FLch8o8gw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DgOwuWmKrnqbO8FLch8o8gw%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D59.822464%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192>First Avenue.”</a> (Demas, 2-3)

    “What else has changed in Stuyvesant Town? Most obviously, the habits of the residents, just as they have changed for the rest of the urban middle class. In the morning, men and women jog around the <a href=https://www.google.com/maps/@40.731245,-73.9778871,3a,75y,4.18h,85.79t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sAF1QipMpmUcgbqIbsArB4f5ItMuDkavTtl1mZC_BS19f!2e10!7i9600!8i4800>Oval</a> before work. There is just a sprinkling of mommies sitting on the benches, most are off pursuing careers…The community seems more activist. Tenants organize not only for their rights, but to preserve the character of Stuyvesant Town as they see it. One of the most notable changes in Stuyvesant Town is that it is now a racially integrated community. A lawsuit in the sixties, initiated by a committee or residents, forced the management to change its discriminatory policies. While the only black faces I saw regular as a child were those of women employed to clean neighbors’ apartments or look after their children, today Stuyvesant Town’s residents more closely mirror the diversity of New York itself.” (Demas, 183) 
<br><br>
“It was easy to think of Stuyvesant Town as a place where I happened to live, a temporary berth, but not a real home in the way that an actual house is. There was the basic difference between renting and owning- renting was like borrowing, owning (even if the true owner was the bank) was the real estate equivalent of immortality. And there was something fundamentally different between an apartment, a series of connected boxes high above the ground, and a house that was rooted in the earth. Stuyvesant Town was suited to transiency. Tenants made no permanent mark on the place. Once they moved on, their apartment was painted over in basic Stuyvesant Town beige, and looked exactly as it did before they moved in; the plastic letters of their name in the hall directory didn’t even leave a shadow behind.” (Demas,184)
<br><br>
    “Although for many residents, Stuyvesant Town was just a place to live until they could afford to buy a home in <a href=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Westchester+County,+NY/@41.1191305,-73.7329966,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c2c96a9d6b59af:0x370ed86222bddb89!8m2!3d41.1220194!4d-73.7948516!16zL20vMGN5bXA>Westchester</a> or on the <a href=https://www.google.com/maps?q=long+island&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjKjIDvpOn9AhX3j4kEHQmaC70Q_AUoAnoECAMQBA>Island</a> , many of the original tenants never moved. Some stayed because of financial considerations, others because they got used to the ways of Stuyvesant Town and found they had no desire to leave. There are mommies who sat on the bench forty years ago, watching their children in the playground, who sit on the same benches forty years ago, watching their children in the playground, who sit in the same benches now and show each other pictures of their grandchildren. There are people who grew up in Stuyvesant Town who are now raising their families there. It is possible that some of the children I grew up with in Stuyvesant Town will never live anywhere else. It is possible that Stuyvesant Town could grace an entire life.” (Demas, 181)
